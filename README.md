Wheel
=====

Wheel is an operating system written from scratch. Currently Wheel is only compatible with 64 bit Intel CPU, running PC hardware.

To build and run Wheel, you need to have `clang`, `yasm`, `ld`, `mtools`, `qemu`, and `mkdocs`.

Run `make` to build this system, run `make doc` to generate document (output directory is `doc/site`).
